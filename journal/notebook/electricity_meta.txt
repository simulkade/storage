Comment	
Please note that the format shown in the example applies to data download as JSON, XML or fetched through the API and is in accordance with the ISO 8601 standard. The format is slightly different when it is shown on screen or downloaded manually as CSV or XLSX. This is mainly due to readability and consideration for Excel users.

In preview (in the GUI) all timestamps are shown as (display convention) YYYY-MM-DD hh:mmZ e.g. 2017-07-14 08:00Z. The Z will remind viewers that this is UTC.

In download (CSV and XLSX) the date time are exported as YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm e.g. 2017-07-14 08:00. That is without the \u201cT\u201d and the \u201cZ\u201d and the seconds. Excel will recognize it as date-time. The user must remember the convention about time zones.

In download (JSON and XML) the full format is used YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmZ e.g. 2017-07-14T08:00Z.
