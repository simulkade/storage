	abstract = {New methods and technologies for energy storage are required to make a transitionto renewable energy sources; in Germany this transition is termed  “Energiewende”. Subsurface georeservoirs, such as salt caverns for hydrogen, compressed air, and methane storage or porous formations for heat and gas storage, offer the possibility of hosting large amounts of energy. When employing these geological storage facilities, an adequate system and process understanding is essential in order to characterize and to predict the complex and interacting effects on other types of subsurface use and on protected entities. In order to make optimal use of georeservoirs, a comprehensive use planning of the subsurface is required that allocates specific uses to appropriate subsurface locations. This paper presents a generic methodology on how subsurface use planning can be conducted and how its scientific basis can be developed. Although synthetic, realistic scenarios for the use of the geological underground for energy storage are parameterized and numerically simulated, accounting for other kinds of subsurface use already in place. From these scenario analyses, the imposed coupled hydraulic, thermal, mechanical and chemical processes, as well as mutual effects and influences on protected entities are assessed and generalized. Based on these, a first methodology for large-scale planning of the geological subsurface considering different surface and subsurface usage scenarios may also be derived.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a data-driven approach for estimating the degree of variability and predictability associated with large-scale wind energy production for a planned integration in a given geographical area, with an application to The Netherlands. A new method is presented for generating realistic time series of aggregated wind power realizations and forecasts. To this end, simultaneous wind speed time series—both actual and predicted—at planned wind farm locations are needed, but not always available. A 1-year data set of 10-min averaged wind speeds measured at several weather stations is used. The measurements are first transformed from sensor height to hub height, then spatially interpolated using multivariate normal theory, and finally averaged over the market resolution time interval. Day-ahead wind speed forecast time series are created from the atmospheric model HiRLAM (High Resolution Limited Area Model). Actual and forecasted wind speeds are passed through multi-turbine power curves and summed up to create time series of actual and forecasted wind power. Two insights are derived from the developed data set: the degree of long-term variability and the degree of predictability when Dutch wind energy production is aggregated at the national or at the market participant level. For a 7.8 GW installed wind power scenario, at the system level, the imbalance energy requirements due to wind variations across 15-min intervals are ±14\% of the total installed capacity, while the imbalance due to forecast errors vary between 53\% for down- and 56\% for up-regulation. When aggregating at the market participant level, the balancing energy requirements are 2–3\% higher. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new simulation method that can fully assess the impacts of large-scale wind power on system operations from cost, reliability, and environmental perspectives. The method uses a time series of observed and predicted 15-min average wind speeds at foreseen onshore- and offshore-wind farm locations. A Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch (UC-ED) tool is adapted to allow for frequent revisions of conventional generation unit schedules, using information on current wind energy output and forecasts for the next 36 h. This is deemed the most faithful way of simulating actual operations and short-term planning activities for a system with large wind power penetration. The problem formulation includes ramp-rate constraints for generation schedules and for reserve activation, and minimum up-time and down-time of conventional units. Results are shown for a realistic future scenario of the Dutch power system. It is shown that problems such as insufficient regulating and reserve power-which are typically associated with the variability and limited predictability of wind power-can only be assessed in conjunction with the specifics of the conventional generation system that wind power is integrated into. For the thermal system with a large share of combined heat and power (CHP) investigated here, wind power forecasting does not provide significant benefits for optimal unit commitment and dispatch. Minimum load problems do occur, which result in wasted wind in amounts increasing with the wind power installed},

	abstract = {Denmark constitutes a low-enthalpy geothermal area, and currently geothermal production takes places from two sandstone-rich formations: the Bunter Sandstone and the Gassum formations. These formations form major geothermal reservoirs in the Danish area, but exploration is associated with high geological uncertainty and information about reservoir permeability is difficult to obtain. Prediction of porosity and permeability prior to drilling is therefore essential in order to reduce risks. Geologically these two formations represent excellent examples of sandstone diversity, since they were deposited in a variety of environments during arid and humid climatic conditions. The study is based on geological and petrophysical data acquired in deep wells onshore Denmark, including conventional core analysis data and well-logs. A method for assessing and predicting the average porosity and permeability of geothermal prospects within the Danish area is presented. Firstly, a porosity-depth trend is established in order to predict porosity. Subsequently, in order to predict permeability, a porosity–permeability relation is established and then refined in steps. Both one basin-wide and one local permeability model are generated. Two porosity-depth models are established. It is shown that the average permeability of a geothermal prospect can be modelled (predicted) using a local permeability model, i.e. a model valid for a geological province including the prospect. The local permeability model is related to a general permeability model through a constant, and the general model thus acts as a template. The applied averaging technique reduces the scatter that is normally seen in a porosity–permeability plot including all raw core analysis measurements and thus narrows the uncertainty band attached to the average permeability estimate for a reservoir layer. A “best practice” technique for predicting average porosity and permeability of geothermal prospects on the basis of core analysis data and well-logs is suggested. The porosity is primarily related to depth, whereas the permeability also depends on porosity, mineralogy and grain size, which are controlled by the depositional environment. Our results indicate that porosity and permeability assessments should be based on averaged data and not raw conventional core analysis data. The uncertainty range of permeability values is significantly lower, when average values are used.},

	abstract = {This work uses pilot examples of CO2 enhanced oil recovery to analyze whether and under which circumstances it is exergetically favorable to sequester CO2 through enhanced oil recovery. We find that the net storage efficiency (ratio between the stored and captured CO2) of the carbon capture and storage (CCS)-only projects is maximally 6–56\% depending on the fuel used in the power plants. With the current state of technology, the CCS process will re-emit a minimum of 0.43–0.94 kg of CO2 per kg of CO2 stored. From thermodynamics point of view, CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) with CCS option is not sustainable, i.e., during the life cycle of the process more energy is consumed than the energy produced from oil. For the CCS to be efficient in reducing CO2 levels (1) the exergetic cost of CO2 separation from flue gas should be reduced, and/or (2) the capture process should not lead to additional carbon emission. Furthermore, we find that the exergy recovery factor of CO2-EOR depends on the CO2 utilization factor, which is currently in the low range of 2–4 bbl/tCO2 based on the field data. Exergetically, CO2 EOR with storage option produces 30–40\% less exergy compared to conventional CO2 enhanced oil recovery projects with CO2 supplied from natural sources; however, this leads to storage of {\textgreater}400 kg of extra CO2 per barrel of oil produced.},

Atmospheric emissions and concentrations of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} continue to increase, making {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} the second most important human-influenced greenhouse gas in terms of climate forcing, after carbon dioxide ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}). The relative importance of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} compared to {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} depends on its shorter atmospheric lifetime, stronger warming potential, and variations in atmospheric growth rate over the past decade, the causes of which are still debated. Two major challenges in reducing uncertainties in the atmospheric growth rate arise from the variety of geographically overlapping {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} sources and from the destruction of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} by short-lived hydroxyl radicals (OH). To address these challenges, we have established a consortium of multidisciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to synthesize and stimulate new research aimed at improving and regularly updating the global methane budget. Following Saunois et al. (2016), we present here the second version of the living review paper dedicated to the decadal methane budget, integrating results of top-down studies (atmospheric observations within an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up estimates (including process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry, inventories of anthropogenic emissions, and data-driven extrapolations).{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}span id="page1564"/{\textgreater}For the 2008–2017 decade, global methane emissions are estimated by atmospheric inversions (a top-down approach) to be 576\&thinsp;Tg\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} (range 550–594, corresponding to the minimum and maximum estimates of the model ensemble).

Since 2012, global {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} emissions have been tracking the warmest scenarios assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Bottom-up methods suggest almost 30\&thinsp;\% larger global emissions (737\&thinsp;Tg\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, range 594–881) than top-down inversion methods. Indeed, bottom-up estimates for natural sources such as natural wetlands, other inland water systems, and geological sources are higher than top-down estimates. The atmospheric constraints on the top-down budget suggest that at least some of these bottom-up emissions are overestimated. The latitudinal distribution of atmospheric observation-based emissions indicates a predominance of tropical emissions ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;65\&thinsp;\% of the global budget, {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\&lt;{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;30{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;N) compared to mid-latitudes ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;30\&thinsp;\%, 30–60{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;N) and high northern latitudes ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;4\&thinsp;\%, 60–90{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;N). The most important source of uncertainty in the methane budget is attributable to natural emissions, especially those from wetlands and other inland waters.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Some of our global source estimates are smaller than those in previously published budgets (Saunois et al., 2016; Kirschke et al., 2013).

Emissions from geological sources and wild animals are also found to be smaller by 7\&thinsp;Tg\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} by 8\&thinsp;Tg\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, respectively. However, the overall discrepancy between bottom-up and top-down estimates has been reduced by only 5\&thinsp;\% compared to Saunois et al. (2016), due to a higher estimate of emissions from inland waters, highlighting the need for more detailed research on emissions factors. Priorities for improving the methane budget include (i) a global, high-resolution map of water-saturated soils and inundated areas emitting methane based on a robust classification of different types of emitting habitats; (ii) further development of process-based models for inland-water emissions; (iii) intensification of methane observations at local scales (e.g., FLUXNET-{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} measurements) and urban-scale monitoring to constrain bottom-up land surface models, and at regional scales (surface networks and satellites) to constrain atmospheric inversions; (iv) improvements of transport models and the representation of photochemical sinks in top-down inversions; and (v) development of a 3D variational inversion system using isotopic and/or co-emitted species such as ethane to improve source partitioning.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The data presented here can be downloaded from {\textless}a href="https://doi.org/10.18160/GCP-CH4-2019"{\textgreater}https://doi.org/10.18160/GCP-CH4-2019{\textless}/a{\textgreater} (Saunois et al., 2020) and from the Global Carbon Project.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is the most efficient energy carrier. Hydrogen can be obtained from different sources of raw materials including water. Among many hydrogen production methods, eco-friendly and high purity of hydrogen can be obtained by water electrolysis. However, In terms of sustainability and environmental impact, PEM water electrolysis was considered as most promising techniques for high pure efficient hydrogen production from renewable energy sources and emits only oxygen as byproduct without any carbon emissions. Moreover, the produced hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) directly used for fuel cell and industrial applications. However, overall water splitting resulting in only 4\% of global industrial hydrogen being produced by electrolysis of water, mainly due to the economic issues. Nowadays, increased the desire production of green hydrogen has increased the interest on PEM water electrolysis. Thus the considerable research has been completed recently in the development of cost effective electrocatalysts for PEM water electrolysis. In this present review, we discussed about the recent developments in the PEM water electrolysis including high performance low cost HER and OER electrocatalysts and their challenges new and old related to electrocatalysts and PEM cell components also addressed. This review will contribute further research improvements and a road map in order to support in developing the PEM water electrolyser as a commercially feasible hydrogen production purpose.},

	abstract = {Water electrolysis derived by renewable energy such as solar energy and wind energy is a sustainable method for hydrogen production due to high purity, simple and green process. One of the challenges is to reduce energy consumption of water electrolysis for large-scale application in future. Cell voltage, an important criterion of energy consumption, consists of theoretical decomposition voltage (Uθ), ohmic voltage drop (i⁎∑R) and reaction overpotential (η). The kinetic and thermodynamic roots of high cell voltage are analyzed systemically in this review. During water electrolysis, bubble coverage on electrode surface and bubble dispersion in electrolyte, namely bubble effect, result in high ohmic voltage drop and large reaction overpotential. Bubble effect is one of the most key factors for high energy consumption. Based on the theoretical analysis, we summarize and divide recent intensification technologies of water electrolysis into three categories: external field, new electrolyte composition and new thermodynamic reaction system. The fundamentals and development of these intensification technologies are discussed and reviewed. Reaction overpotential and ohmic voltage drop are improved kinetically by external field or new electrolyte composition. The thermodynamic decomposition voltage of water is also reduced by new reaction systems such as solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) and carbon assisted water electrolysis (CAWE).},

With the growing capacity of localized renewable energy sources surpassing the gigawatt range, a storage system of equal magnitude is required. PEM electrolysis provides a sustainable solution for the production of hydrogen, and is well suited to couple with energy sources such as wind and solar. However, due to low demand in electrolytic hydrogen in the last century, little research has been done on PEM electrolysis with many challenges still unexplored. The ever increasing desire for green energy has rekindled the interest on PEM electrolysis, thus the compilation and recovery of past research and developments is important and necessary. In this review, PEM water electrolysis is comprehensively highlighted and discussed. The challenges new and old related to electrocatalysts, solid electrolyte, current collectors, separator plates and modeling efforts will also be addressed. The main message is to clearly set the state-of-the-art for the PEM electrolysis technology, be insightful of the research that is already done and the challenges that still exist. This information will provide several future research directions and a road map in order to aid scientists in establishing PEM electrolysis as a commercially viable hydrogen production solution.},

	abstract = {Increased emissions of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere has adversely been contributing to global warming as a result of burning fossil fuels. Therefore, the energy sectors have been looking into renewable sources such as wind, solar, and hydro energy to make electricity. However, the strongly fluctuating nature of electricity from such energy sources requires a bulk energy storage system to store the excess energy as a buffer and to fulfill the demand constantly. Underground storage is a proven way to store a huge amount of energy (electricity) after converting it into hydrogen as it has higher energy content per unit mass than other gases such as methane and natural gas. This paper reviews the technical aspects and feasibility of the underground storage of hydrogen into depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, aquifers, and manmade underground cavity (caverns). Mechanisms of underground hydrogen storage (UHS) followed by numerous phenomena such as hydrodynamics, geochemical, physiochemical, bio-chemical, or microbial reactions have been deliberated. Modeling studies have also been incorporated in the literature to assess the feasibility of the process that are also reviewed in this paper. Worldwide ongoing lab study, field study together with potential storage sites have been reported as well. Technical challenges along with proper remedial techniques and economic viability have been briefly discussed. Finally, this paper delivers some feasible strategies for the underground hydrogen storage process, which would be helpful for future research and development of UHS.},

	abstract = {Life cycle assessment is extended to exergetic life cycle assessment and used to evaluate the exergy efficiency, economic effectiveness and environmental impact of producing hydrogen using wind and solar energy in place of fossil fuels. The product hydrogen is considered a fuel for fuel cell vehicles and a substitute for gasoline. Fossil fuel technologies for producing hydrogen from natural gas and gasoline from crude oil are contrasted with options using renewable energy. Exergy efficiencies and greenhouse gas and air pollution emissions are evaluated for all process steps, including crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation, crude oil distillation and natural gas reforming, wind and solar electricity generation, hydrogen production through water electrolysis, and gasoline and hydrogen distribution and utilization. The use of wind power to produce hydrogen via electrolysis, and its application in a fuel cell vehicle, exhibits the lowest fossil and mineral resource consumption rate. However, the economic attractiveness, as measured by a “capital investment effectiveness factor,” of renewable technologies depends significantly on the ratio of costs for hydrogen and natural gas. At the present cost ratio of about 2 (per unit of lower heating value or exergy), capital investments are about five times lower to produce hydrogen via natural gas rather than wind energy. As a consequence, the cost of wind- and solar-based electricity and hydrogen is substantially higher than that of natural gas. The implementation of a hydrogen fuel cell instead of an internal combustion engine permits, theoretically, an increase in a vehicle's engine efficiency of about of two times. Depending on the ratio in engine efficiencies, the substitution of gasoline with “renewable” hydrogen leads to (a) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions of 12–23 times for hydrogen from wind and 5–8 times for hydrogen from solar energy, and (b) air pollution (AP) emissions reductions of 38–76 times for hydrogen from wind and 16–32 times for hydrogen from solar energy. By comparison, substitution of gasoline with hydrogen from natural gas allows reductions in GHG emissions only as a result of the increased efficiency of a fuel cell engine, and a reduction of AP emissions of 2.5–5 times. These data suggest that “renewable” hydrogen represents a potential long-term solution to many environmental problems.},

Nonetheless, a growing body of evidence suggests these technologies form an attractive option for the deep decarbonisation of global energy systems, and that recent improvements in their cost and performance point towards economic viability as well. This paper is a comprehensive review of the potential role that hydrogen could play in the provision of electricity, heat, industry, transport and energy storage in a low-carbon energy system, and an assessment of the status of hydrogen in being able to fulfil that potential. The picture that emerges is one of qualified promise: hydrogen is well established in certain niches such as forklift trucks, while mainstream applications are now forthcoming. Hydrogen vehicles are available commercially in several countries, and 225 000 fuel cell home heating systems have been sold. This represents a step change from the situation of only five years ago. This review shows that challenges around cost and performance remain, and considerable improvements are still required for hydrogen to become truly competitive. But such competitiveness in the medium-term future no longer seems an unrealistic prospect, which fully justifies the growing interest and policy support for these technologies around the world.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen storage in depleted gas fields is a promising option for the large-scale storage of excess renewable energy. In the framework of the hydrogen storage assessment for the “Underground Sun Storage” project, we conduct a multi-step geochemical modelling approach to study fluid–rock interactions by means of equilibrium and kinetic batch simulations. With the equilibrium approach, we estimate the long-term consequences of hydrogen storage, whereas kinetic models are used to investigate the interactions between hydrogen and the formation on the time scales of typical storage cycles. The kinetic approach suggests that reactions of hydrogen with minerals become only relevant over timescales much longer than the considered storage cycles. The final kinetic model considers both mineral reactions and hydrogen dissolution to be kinetically controlled. Interactions among hydrogen and aqueous-phase components seem to be dominant within the storage-relevant time span. Additionally, sensitivity analyses of hydrogen dissolution kinetics, which we consider to be the controlling parameter of the overall reaction system, were performed. Reliable data on the kinetic rates of mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions, specifically in the presence of hydrogen, are scarce and often not representative of the studied conditions. These uncertainties in the kinetic rates for minerals such as pyrite and pyrrhotite were investigated and are discussed in the present work. The proposed geochemical workflow provides valuable insight into controlling mechanisms and risk evaluation of hydrogen storage projects and may serve as a guideline for future investigations.},

	abstract = {This article addresses the impact of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) on Poland’s conventional energy sector in 2008–2020 and further till 2050. Poland is a country with over 80\% dependence on coal in the power sector being under political pressure of the European Union’s (EU) ambitious climate policy. The impact of the increase of the European Emission Allowance (EUA) price on fossil fuel power sector has been modelled for different scenarios. The innovation of this article consists in proposing a methodology of estimation actual costs and benefits of power stations in a country with a heavily coal-dependent power sector in the process of transition to a low-carbon economy. Strong political and economic interdependence of coal and power sector has been demonstrated as well as the impact caused by the EU ETS participation in different technology groups of power plants. It has been shown that gas-fuelled combined heat and power units are less vulnerable to the EU ETS-related costs, whereas the hard coal-fired plants may lose their profitability soon after 2020. Lignite power plants, despite their high emissivity, may longer remain in operation owing to low operational costs. Additionally, the results of long-term, up to 2050, modelling of Poland’s energy sector supported an unavoidable need of deep decarbonisation of the power sector to meet the post-Paris climate objectives. It has been concluded that investing in coal-based power capacity may lead to a carbon lock-in of the power sector. Finally, the overall costs of such a transformation have been discussed and confronted with the financial support offered by the EU. The whole consideration has been made in a wide context of changes ongoing globally in energy markets and compared with some other countries seeking transformation paths from coal. Poland’s case can serve as a lesson for all countries trying to reduce coal dependence in power generation. Reforms in the energy sector shall from the very beginning be an essential part of a sustainable transition of the whole nation’s economy. They must scale the power capacity to the future demand avoiding stranded costs. The reforms must be wide-ranging, based on a wide political consensus and not biased against the coal sector. Future energy mix and corresponding technologies shall be carefully designed, matched and should remain stable in the long-term perspective. Coal-based power capacity being near the end of its lifetime provides an economically viable option to commence a fuel switch and the following technology replacement. Real benefits and costs of the energy transition shall be fairly allocated to all stakeholders and communicated to the society. The social costs and implications in coal-dependent regions may be high, especially in the short-term perspective, but then the transformation will bring profits to the whole society.},

Furthermore, nickel was considered to be a highly favourable choice as a catalyst to facilitate the methanation process, given its high activity and selectivity ranking and low cost. Moreover, the fixed-bed reactor systems were determined to be a common choice for synthetic natural gas production due to their simple and effective design. However, honeycomb reactors and microchannel reactors were considered more favourable in regards to catalyst exposure within the rector.},

This micro-continuum model is rooted in elementary physics and volume averaging principles, where a unique set of partial differential equations is used to represent flow in both regions and scales. The crux of the proposed model is that it tends asymptotically towards the Navier-Stokes volume-of-fluid approach in solid-free regions and towards the multiphase Darcy equations in porous regions. Unlike existing multiscale multiphase solvers, it can match analytical predictions of capillary, relative permeability, and gravitational effects at both the pore and Darcy scales. Through its open-source implementation, hybridPorousInterFoam, the proposed approach marks the extension of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation packages into porous multiscale, multiphase systems. The versatility of the solver is illustrated using applications to two-phase flow in a fractured porous matrix and wave interaction with a porous coastal barrier.},

Electricity is generated in the turbine, which is used by the PEM electrolyzer to produce hydrogen. A simulation program using Matlab software is developed to model the PEM electrolyzer and OTEC system. The simulation model for the PEM electrolyzer used in this study is validated with experimental data from the literature. The amount of hydrogen produced, the exergy destruction of each component and the overall system, and the exergy efficiency of the system are calculated. To better understand the effect of various parameters on system performance, a parametric analysis is carried out. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the integrated OTEC system are 3.6\% and 22.7\% respectively, and the exergy efficiency of the PEM electrolyzer is about 56.5\% while the amount of hydrogen produced by it is 1.2 kg/h.},

In this paper, the thermodynamic performance of an electrolysis process for producing hydrogen from water and heat is investigated, based on current technology. The study considers the flows of energy and exergy through the various steps comprising the total process. (It is useful to examine both energy and exergy in evaluating process performance because energy analysis on its own does not pinpoint the true process inefficiencies, and often does not provide rational efficiencies.) The flows of energy and exergy were evaluated using an energy-exergy analysis computer code, which the authors had previously developed. The analysis has indicated that (1) the principal losses occur in the electrolysis unit and electricity generation plant; (2) the losses are mainly due to the irreversibilities associated with chemical reaction and heat transfer across large temperature differences; and (3) the losses associated with cooling water streams, because of their low quality, are not as significant as energy analysis indicated.},

Our analysis exposes that it is possible to increase the exergy efficiency of the water electrolyzer and CO2 hydrogenation system by thermal coupling, where the thermal energy required to split water into H2 and O2 during the electrolysis process is compensated by the heat generated during the CO2 hydrogenation reaction.

	abstract = {The accurate knowledge of the energy efficiency coefficient of near ambient temperature water electrolysis (Alkaline, PEM or AEM Electrolyzer) is a critical-point to estimate the total cost of electrolytic hydrogen. After describing the fundamentals of these three processes and presenting the main data of water electro-dissociation under given temperature and pressure conditions, the energy efficiency coefficient can be calculated by taking the ratio of the theoretical energy (ΔH) to decompose water under equilibrium conditions (no current) to the real energy used (ΔH + energy losses) to electrolyze water at a given current intensity. Different approximations of this coefficient are discussed and compared to data from literature. Such coefficient can also be calculated by taking the ratio of the total energy of hydrogen collected at the exhaust of the electrolyzer to the total energy (electricity + heat) supplied to the complete system. It is demonstrated that both definitions are consistent and similar if all the energy involved is taken into account. It is also shown that some approximations, in particular those neglecting the thermal energy in the denominator of this ratio, give efficiency coefficients larger than unity for cell voltages lower than the thermo-neutral voltage, which is a thermodynamic non-sense.},

As conventional electrolyzers are designed for operation at fixed process conditions, the implementation of fluctuating and highly intermittent renewable energy is challenging. This contribution shows the recent state of system descriptions for alkaline water electrolysis and renewable energies, such as solar and wind power. Each component of a hydrogen energy system needs to be optimized to increase the operation time and system efficiency. Only in this way can hydrogen produced by electrolysis processes be competitive with the conventional path based on fossil energy sources. Conventional alkaline water electrolyzers show a limited part-load range due to an increased gas impurity at low power availability. As explosive mixtures of hydrogen and oxygen must be prevented, a safety shutdown is performed when reaching specific gas contamination. Furthermore, the cell voltage should be optimized to maintain a high efficiency. While photovoltaic panels can be directly coupled to alkaline water electrolyzers, wind turbines require suitable converters with additional losses. By combining alkaline water electrolysis with hydrogen storage tanks and fuel cells, power grid stabilization can be performed. As a consequence, the conventional spinning reserve can be reduced, which additionally lowers the carbon dioxide emissions.},

	url = {https://lutpub.lut.fi/handle/10024/104326},
	abstract = {An electric system based on renewable energy faces challenges concerning the storage and utilization of energy due to the intermittent and seasonal nature of renewable energy sources. Wind and solar photovoltaic power productions are variable and difficult to predict, and thus electricity storage will be needed in the case of basic power production. Hydrogen’s energetic potential lies in its ability and versatility to store chemical energy, to serve as an energy carrier and as feedstock for various industries. Hydrogen is also used e.g. in the production of biofuels. The amount of energy produced during hydrogen combustion is higher than any other fuel’s on a mass basis with a higher-heating-value of 39.4 kWh/kg. However, even though hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, on Earth most hydrogen exists in molecular forms such as water. Therefore, hydrogen must be produced and there are various methods to do so. Today, the majority hydrogen comes from fossil fuels, mainly from steam methane reforming, and only about 4 \% of global hydrogen comes from water electrolysis. Combination of electrolytic production of hydrogen from water and supply of renewable energy is attracting more interest due to the sustainability and the increased flexibility of the resulting energy system. The preferred option for intermittent hydrogen storage is pressurization in tanks since at ambient conditions the volumetric energy density of hydrogen is low, and pressurized tanks are efficient and affordable when the cycling rate is high. Pressurized hydrogen enables energy storage in larger capacities compared to battery technologies and additionally the energy can be stored for longer periods of time, on a time scale of months. 
In this thesis, the thermodynamics and electrochemistry associated with water electrolysis are described. The main water electrolysis technologies are presented with state-of-the-art specifications. Finally, a Power-to-Hydrogen infrastructure design for Lappeenranta University of Technology is presented. Laboratory setup for water electrolysis is specified and factors affecting its commissioning in Finland are presented.},

This paper reviews the published works on performance degradations and mitigation strategies for PEMWE. Sources of degradation for individual components are introduced. With degradation causes discussed and degradation mechanisms examined, the review emphasizes on feasible strategies to mitigate the components degradation. To avoid lengthy real lifetime degradation tests and their high costs, the importance of accelerated stress tests and protocols is highlighted for various components.

	abstract = {AbstractHydrogen is currently assessed as a future clean fuel in a hydrogen economy. However, one key problem with implementing a full-scale hydrogen economy is hydrogen storage (as hydrogen is highly compressible and volatile). One solution for this problem is hydrogen geo-storage, where compressed hydrogen is injected into geological formations; and the hydrogen can be withdrawn again at any time. However, there is a serious lack of data for realistic geologic conditions, including for hydrogen rock wettability, which is proven to determine injectivities, withdrawal rates, storage capacities, and containment security. We thus measured this parameter at various geo-storage conditions. For a realistic storage scenario in a deep sandstone aquifer, we found that the rock (quartz) was weakly water-wet or intermediate-wet. Increasing pressure, temperature, and organic surface concentration increased hydrogen-wettability. This work thus provides fundamental data and aids in the industrial-scale implementation of a future hydrogen economy.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

The traveling wave solution is presented in an explicit form of the space and time variables, and it takes into account both gravity and Klinkenberg effects (pressure-dependent permeability). We investigated the properties of the traveling wave solution and the effect of some parameters such as the Klinkenberg coefficient. A numerical study has been carried out, which confirms the stability of the traveling wave solution. The traveling wave solution is then used to derive two benchmark solutions defined over the semi-infinite domain. The first one assumes uniform initial gas pressure and non-uniform boundary condition, and the second assumes uniform boundary condition and non-uniform initial distribution of the gas pressure. The benchmark solutions are easy to use and are useful for validating numerical solutions. Two illustrative examples are presented in order to compare the benchmark solutions with the numerical solutions. The results show good agreements between the solutions.},

Catalytic materials for the two reactions were mostly studied separately, with very few works assessing the feasibility of the same system for both. Here, key kinetic drivers of methanol synthesis (MS) and methanol steam reforming (MSR) were identified for the main catalyst families, with special focus on Cu?ZnO?Al2O3, In2O3, and Pd/ZrO2. It was shown that the relative activity level was preserved in either direction, whereas the distinctly favored (reverse) water-gas shift modulated selectivity differently. Low selectivity in kinetically controlled MS could be overcome in MSR by exploiting thermodynamics as the driving force, with many catalysts unfit for MS still comprising appealing candidates for MSR and only few being suited for MS as well as MSR. Overall, readily identifiable properties describing catalyst behavior in the forward and backward reactions were highlighted, effectively linking research in the two fields and setting a stronger basis for developing a methanol-based hydrogen storage unit with a single reactor.},

	abstract = {Converting CO2-rich waste streams such as raw biogas, landfill gas and power plant flue gas into synthetic fuels and chemicals will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, providing revenue at the same time. One option is to convert CO2 into CH4 by hydrogenation via Sabatier reaction. This synthetic methane will be renewable if the H2 required for the reaction is generated via water electrolysis using solar and wind energy or hydroelectricity. However, to realize the potential of this approach, a number of technological challenges related to the Sabatier reactor design have to be resolved, including thermal management. The high exothermicity of the Sabatier reaction can lead to reactor overheating. High temperatures are unfavorable to the exothermic and reversible methanation process, resulting in low CO2 conversions. A simulation-based study of a Sabatier reactor was performed in order to optimize the removal of heat, while maximizing CO2 conversion and CH4 production. The heat-exchanger type packed bed reactor with internal cooling by a molten salt was simulated using a transient, pseudo-homogeneous mathematical model. Reactor performance was evaluated in terms of CO2 conversion and CH4 yield. The simulation results show that feed temperature, feed flow rate, and molten salt flow rate are the crucial parameters affecting the reactor performance. For the optimized operating conditions, the model predicts CO2 conversions and CH4 yields above 90\% at high reactor throughputs, with space velocities up to 10,000h−1. A preliminary techno-economic evaluation is provided: opportunities and challenges are outlined.},

The results suggest that the membrane reactor is a promising alternative to carry out ATR of methane at milder conditions than those commonly found in a conventional reactor.

	abstract = {A bifunctional Ni/MgO catalyst was prepared to catalyze CO2 methanation and make use of CO2 as an abundant hydrogen storage facility. The effect of Ni loading and MgO quality on the rate of methanation was tested in a temperature range of 533–648K. The Ni loading was varied between 0 to 27wt.\% on MgO. To investigate the impact of matrix elements, a MgO/CaO support was tested with 21wt.\% nickel loading. Further, the role of MgO in the bifunctional catalyst was proven. The reaction kinetics was modeled with a Langmuir–Hinshelwood approach considering the bifunctional character of the catalyst. Nickel provides the adsorbent capacity for hydrogen and is highly selective for methane. MgO activates CO2 through chemisorption. Increasing Ni loading of the catalyst increased the rate of CO2 conversion. According to the results, the mechanism of CO2 methanation did not change with Ni loading. The Ni/MgO catalyst acted as a robust, active and highly selective catalyst for CO2 methanation. With CO2 conversion of 87\%, the selectivity to methane was ≥99\%. Besides excellent catalytic activity the catalysts suffice the necessity of simple catalyst preparation, usage and recyclability for industrial applicability of CO2 methanation.},

This modeling study aims at a basic understanding of the aspects relevant for designing an externally cooled fixed-bed reactor for the methanation of a pure, stoichiometric feed gas. It is shown that the reaction rates and the exothermicity (ΔH°=−165kJ/mol) prevent a fixed-bed reactor of technical dimensions to be operated at high conversions without runaway of the reactor. The model predictions of differently detailed pseudo-homogeneous reactor models and a heterogeneous reactor model where the intraparticle transport of mass is described according to a dusty-gas approach are compared to assess the needed level of detail in terms of modeling the heat transfer, fluid flow characteristics and transport resistances on the pellet scale. Under specific conditions, intraparticle mass transfer and external heat transfer need to be considered for describing the temperature and concentration profiles adequately. The study is completed by modeling a fixed-bed membrane reactor as an example of a structured reactor that offers improved temperature control by separated and controlled feeding of hydrogen and carbon dioxide.},

	abstract = {As the use of hydrogen gas (H2) as a renewable energy carrier experiences a major boost, one of the key challenges for a constant supply is safe and cost-efficient storage of surplus H2 to bridge periods with low energy demand. For this purpose, underground gas storage (UGS) in salt caverns, deep aquifers and oil-/gas reservoirs has been proposed, which are environments with potentially high microbial abundance and activity. Subsurface microorganisms can use H2 in their metabolism and thus may lead to a variety of undesired side effects such as H2 loss, H2S formation, methane formation, acid formation, clogging and corrosion. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge and methodologies on microbial related risks related to H2 UGS, including basic research on subsurface microbiology, results from field trials, and experience from other industries including oil \& gas. For safe underground storage of H2 gas we recommend to analyze the relevant microbiological and geochemical characteristics of each site to be able to predict the most suitable storage strategy and establish a good monitoring and mitigation approach to follow and counter potential microbial side effects.},

One key feature of pyomo.dae is that it does not restrict users to standard, predeﬁned forms of differential equations, providing a high degree of modeling ﬂexibility and the ability to express constraints that cannot be easily speciﬁed in other modeling frameworks. Other key features of pyomo.dae are the ability to specify optimization problems with high-order differential equations and partial differential equations, deﬁned on restricted domain types, and the ability to automatically transform high-level abstract models into ﬁnite-dimensional algebraic problems that can be solved with off-the-shelf solvers. Moreover, pyomo.dae users can leverage existing capabilities of Pyomo to embed differential equation models within stochastic and integer programming models and mathematical programs with equilibrium constraint formulations. Collectively, these features enable the exploration of new modeling concepts, discretization schemes, and the benchmarking of state-of-the-art optimization solvers.},

	abstract = {Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is a well-known process in which CH4 and CO2 catalytically react to produce syngas. Solid carbon is a well-known byproduct of the DRM but is undesirable as it leads to catalyst deactivation. However, converting CO2 and CH4 into solid carbon serves as a promising carbon capture and sequestration technique that has been demonstrated in this study by two patented processes. In the first process, known as CARGEN technology (CARbon GENerator), a novel concept of two reactors in series is developed that separately convert the greenhouse gases (GHGs) into multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and syngas. CARGEN enables at least a 50\% reduction in energy requirement with at least 65\% CO2 conversion compared to the DRM process. The second process presents an alternative pathway for the regeneration/reactivation of the spent DRM/CARGEN catalyst using CO2. Provided herein is the first report on an experimental demonstration of a 'switching' technology in which CO2 is utilized in both the operation and the regeneration cycles and thus, finally contributing to the overall goal of CO2 fixation. The following studies support all the results in this work: physisorption, chemisorption, XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, TGA, ICP, and Raman analysis.},

	abstract = {Expectations for energy storage are high but large-scale underground hydrogen storage in porous media (UHSP) remains largely untested. This article identifies and discusses the scientific challenges of hydrogen storage in porous media for safe and efficient large-scale energy storage to enable a global hydrogen economy. To facilitate hydrogen supply on the scales required for a zero-carbon future, it must be stored in porous geological formations, such as saline aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs. Large-scale UHSP offers the much-needed capacity to balance inter-seasonal discrepancies between demand and supply, decouple energy generation from demand and decarbonise heating and transport, supporting decarbonisation of the entire energy system. Despite the vast opportunity provided by UHSP, the maturity is considered low and as such UHSP is associated with several uncertainties and challenges. Here, the safety and economic impacts triggered by poorly understood key processes are identified, such as the formation of corrosive hydrogen sulfide gas, hydrogen loss due to the activity of microbes or permeability changes due to geochemical interactions impacting on the predictability of hydrogen flow through porous media. The wide range of scientific challenges facing UHSP are outlined to improve procedures and workflows for the hydrogen storage cycle, from site selection to storage site operation. Multidisciplinary research, including reservoir engineering, chemistry, geology and microbiology, more complex than required for CH4 or CO2 storage is required in order to implement the safe, efficient and much needed large-scale commercial deployment of UHSP.},

Avedøre Power Plant is a high-technology facility and one of the world's most efficient of its kind, being able to utilize as much as 94\% of the energy in the fuel and convert 49\% of the fuel energy into electricity. Apart from using coal, petroleum (oil) and natural gas, the plant runs on a wide variety of biomass fuels such as straw and wood pellets. The plant consists of two units with a total capacity of 793 MW of electricity and 918 MW of heat. The combination of producing electricity (combined heat and power) and heat for district heating at the same time is widely used in Denmark and the rest of Scandinavia, due to the need of domestic (and industrial) heating together with the Danish energy companies putting a big effort into optimising the energy plants.
The Avedøre Power Station was designed by the architects Claus Bjarrum and Jørgen Hauxner.},

	abstract = {The starting point for this study was an incident in an industrial plant, where the ammonia synthesis reactor became unstable with rapid temperature oscillations (limit-cycles) in the range from about 300°C to 500°C. A simple dynamic model reproduces this behavior. In industry a steady-state van Heerden analysis is often used to analyze the stability, but a more careful analysis for this reactor system reveals that instability occurs when there still is a positive steady-state margin, namely as a pair of complex conjugate poles cross the imaginary axis (Hopf bifurcation). This is consistent with the obseruations where the instability manifests itself as oscillations rather than extinction of the reaction. This somewhat unusual behavior can be explained by the presence of an inverse response for the temperature response through the reactor beds combined with the positive feedback caused by the preheater.},

The purpose of this paper is to develop the economically optimum design of a methanol reactor/distillation column system with three gas recycle streams to produce high-purity methanol from synthesis gas. The economics consider capital costs, energy costs, the value of the methanol product, and the heating value of a vent stream that is necessary for purging off inert components entering in the feed. A plantwide control structure is developed that is capable of effectively handling large disturbances in the production rate and synthesis gas composition. The unique features of this control scheme are a lack of control of pressure in the reactor/recycle gas loop and a high-pressure override controller to handle stoichiometric imbalances in the composition of the synthesis gas feed.},

Early developments (1970–1980) using syngas from coal gasification plants primarily focused on fixed-bed and fluidized-bed methanation technologies. Temperature control and catalyst deactivation, e.g. caused by fouling and mechanical stress, were key issues of investigation. Due to the debate about a sustainable energy supply, research on methanation has been intensified during the last ten years. Novel reactor developments comprise e.g. micro reactors and three-phase reactors aiming at an advanced temperature control and a reduced complexity of future methanation plants. The developments are supported by detailed modeling and simulation work to optimize the design and dynamic behavior. To accompany and facilitate new methanation developments, the present work is aimed at giving researchers a comprehensive overview of methanation research conducted during the last century. On one hand, application-orientated research focusing on reactor developments, reactor modeling, and pilot plant investigation is reviewed. On the other hand, fundamentals such as reaction mechanisms and catalyst deactivation are presented.},

	abstract = {Energy transition to a high proportion of fluctuating electricity obtained from fluctuating wind and solar power generators requires electricity to be stored at various scales. This chapter looks at grid-scale storage on the basis of electrolytically formed hydrogen. Previous forecasts indicate that an industrial country like Germany requires storage capacities in the double-figure terawatt range in the long term. Volumes of energy at this scale can only be stored in the form of hydrogen or in the form of methane synthesized by combining hydrogen with carbon dioxide—in other words, chemical methods. The main method available for the large-scale storage of hydrogen gas is to store the gas in artificially constructed salt caverns. Practical experience has already been gained from the storage of town gas, which contains large amounts of hydrogen, as well as the storage of pure hydrogen. Because suitable salt formations are not available everywhere, other alternatives are being sought, such as the methods used for the storage of natural gas: depleted gas fields and aquifer formations. Research in this context is mainly focused on looking at potential reactions between hydrogen and the constituents of the reservoirs (minerals, fluids, and microorganisms).},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13581},
	abstract = {This study sets out to analyze future synergies between the O\&G and renewables sectors and explore how exploiting these synergies could lead to economic and environmental benefits. By firstly reviewing and highlighting relevant technologies and related projects, this report synthesizes the state of the art in offshore energy system integration, by focusing on three key technologies in electrification/floating wind, electrolysis/hydrogen production and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). With a timeframe out to 2050 and model scope including all North Sea neighbouring countries, this analysis explores a total of nine future scenarios for the North Sea energy system. The main results include an immediate electrification of all operational DUC platforms by linking them to the shore and/or a planned Danish energy island. These measures result in cost and CO2 emissions savings compared to a BAU scenario of 72\% and 85\% respectively. When these platforms cease production, this is followed by the repurposing of the platforms into hydrogen generators with up to 3.6 GW of electrolysers and the development of up to 5.8 GW of floating wind. The generated hydrogen is assumed to power the future transport sector, and is delivered to shore in existing and/or new purpose-built pipelines. The contribution of the O\&G sector to this hydrogen production amounts to around 19 TWh, which represents about 2\% of total European hydrogen demand for transport in 2050. The levelized costs (LCOE) of producing this hydrogen in 2050 are around 4 euro2012/kg H2, which is around twice those expected in similar studies. But this does not account for energy policies that may incentivize green hydrogen production in the future, which would serve to reduce this LCOE to a level that is more competitive with other sources.},
