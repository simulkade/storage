# This is sample input file for the prototype subsurface energy storage 
# Matlab software. 
# Rules
# Add comments by #
#  - Only add commnets in separate lines
#  - it is fine to add comments at the end of lines
# Use only capital letters for keywords
# Seperate keywords from their value by spaces in the same line
# - Use as many space as you like
# The keywords are shown and documented by way of example in this file
# and also explained in the report
# Add as many empty lines as you like to separate the input lines


# 1- computational domain
COORDINATE CARTESIAN # Can take values CARTESIAN, CYLINDRICAL
DIMENSION 2         # takes also 1 and 3 (1D, 2D, 3D)
Length 1000.0        # Length of the domain horizontally, in meters
THICKNESS 50.0       # Thickness of the reservoir
WIDTH 1.0            # Only for horizontal coordinates, the second horizontal dimension
                     # It is represented as z axis in the code
DEPTH 2000.0         # depth of the reservoirs from the top
RADIUS 1000.0        # For cylindrical domains, similar to length
NX 100               # number of cells in the horizontal X (R) for Cartesian (Cylindrical)
NY 20                # number of cells in the vertical Y (Z) for Cartesian (Cylindrical)
NZ 10                # number of cells in the second horizontal Z (theta) for Cartesian (Cylindrical)
