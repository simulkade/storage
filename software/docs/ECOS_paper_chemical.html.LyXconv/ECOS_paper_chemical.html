<!--l. 81--><p class="noindent" >Wind electricity is an intermittent and volatile source of energy <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XgibescuEstimationVariabilityPredictability2009">22</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XummelsImpactsWindPower2007">41</a>]</span>. When there
is no or little wind, there is not enough electricity to match the demand; when there
is too much wind, if the electricity is not consumed immediately, it will be wasted.
The Ciara storm in February 2020, which was only partially felt in Denmark,
increased the Danish wind electricity production to 1000 Mega Watts (MW) above
consumption, i.e. 20% higher that is equivalent to the average demand of one
million European citizens. There were reports of significant curtailments
up to several thousand MW from other countries in the North Sea region.
Curtailment <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XlewWindSolarCurtailment2013">28</a>]</span>, which means accepting less renewable electricity than what
windfarms can deliver is another word for wasted resources. It will soon
become more severe when the North Sea is hit by a technological storm in the
form of several large wind farms that are currently evaluated, planned, and
licensed <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XGlobalOffshoreRenewable">1</a>]</span>. More importantly, since the electricity distribution is planned
based on the unavailability of wind resources, the biomass (that is regularly
switched to coal) power plants must always be running to compensate for
the shortage of wind, thus emitting a large amount of carbon dioxide and
other pollutants <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XmeibomEnergyComesTogether2013">33</a>]</span>. The solution is to store electricity when production is
higher than demand and consume it when demand is higher than production
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XpedersenEnergyStorageTechnologies2019">37</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" >The oil and gas extraction from the Danish sector of the North Sea has been
declining, which will lead to the cessation of production and abandonment (i.e.,
plugging of the wells and removal of the facilities). Simultaneously, the existing and
in development offshore windmills in the North Sea will ensure the availability of
abundant and cheap electricity in the region yet fail to address the intermittent
nature of the wind resources. This paper hypothesizes that the surplus electricity in
the windy days and off-peak time can be converted to chemical energy (synthetic
fuels, i.e. hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, or methane) forms and stored in the vast
space of the abandoned oil and gas reservoirs under the North Sea. The
stored energy can be extracted and consumed as carbon-neutral fuels for
transportation or be converted back to electricity when there is a shortage of wind.
This paper studies the technical and thermodynamic feasibility of offshore
conversion of electricity to chemical energy sources. The technical feasibility study

deals with the sufficiency of the existing infrastructures including platforms,
pipelines, and surface facilities to accommodate the process equipment for the
conversion of electricity to chemical storable forms. Several processes including
nitrogen and carbon dioxide separation from the atmosphere, electrolysis of
seawater, and reduction of CO<sub><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sub> and N<sub><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sub> to synthetic fuels are simulated in
Aspen Plus process simulator. The simulation results are used for the sizing
of process equipment and the calculation of required platform area. The
thermodynamic analysis quantifies the exergy loss during the conversion of
electricity to fuel and back, and storage/extraction of chemical energy in the
reservoirs based on the results of an in-house opensource dynamic model that
simulates the multicomponent non-isothermal flow of fluids in the subsurface
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XeftekhariFVToolFiniteVolume2015b">13</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 134--><p class="noindent" >There are three major questions that will be answered in this work. First, how much
energy storage is needed in Denmark? Secondly, to what extent can the subsurface
storage be helpful in addressing the intermittency of the renewable electricity?
Thirdly, what are the promising technologies from a technical point of view? This
paper will provide simple, reproducible, and realistic procedures and quantitative
answers to these questions.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Future energy need of Denmark</h3>
<!--l. 144--><p class="noindent" >Denmark currently consumes around 100 kWh per person per day of energy in
different forms. Eftekhari <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XeftekhariQuantifyingRoleLiquid2020">15</a>]</span> showed that this can be further categorized into 30%
electricity, 30% heat, and 40% hydrocarbon fuel. Note that the hydrocarbon
consumption for electricity production is not included in the 40% hydrocarbon fuel.
We can assume that in the future, all the warming systems and short distance
transport will be electrified; therefore, by assuming a realistic (yet conservative)
coefficient of performance of 2.0 for the future warming systems, we can estimate a
demand of 45 kWh/day electricity per person and 40 kWh/day liquid fuel per person.
As for electricity production, the current plan is to quadruple the current
electricity capacity of the wind mills in the North Sea. Since the capacity is not
equal to the actual produced electricity (due to, e.g. technical problems,
curtailment, weather conditions, etc.) we will estimate the intermittent electricity
production of the windmills by quadrupling the current electricity production in
Denmark that is available from Energinet.dk website and also available as a
public repository <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XeftekhariSimulkadeStorageFirst2021">14</a>]</span>, including several Matlab functions for analysis and
visualizations.

href="#XdandreaSynergiesOffshoreEnergy2021">12</a>]</span>. Note that this increase will be on
the offshore sector only; however, here we assume that the overall wind energy
capacity will increase by a factor of four. The other assumption in Eq. (<a 
href="#x1-2002r2">2<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:demand-adjust --></a>) is that
the weather (more specifically, wind) in 2050 will be similar to the weather
condition in 2020. The visualized energy supply and demand in Fig. <a 
href="#x1-2003r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Electricity-surplus-smooth --></a> shows
that periodically, the wind electricity supply is higher or lower than the
electricity demand, creating periods with electricity surplus and shortage,
respectively. The alternation between surplus and shortage can occur within a
few hours to few weeks. This is better visualized in Fig. <a 
href="#x1-2004r2">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Average-electricity-supply --></a> that shows the
average surplus and shortage for periods of 24 hours to 8 months. It can be
observed that after around six months, the average surplus and shortage
reach a constant value. This plot unveils three critical pieces of information
about the wind electricity supply and demand in 2050: first, the average
shortage of electricity is 1.6 GW, which is a large amount of power and gives
an indication of the amount of energy that needs to be stored (although
sometimes the actual power shortage is temporarily higher as shown later).
The good news is that the average electricity surplus is 2.25 GW, which is
620 MW higher than the average electricity shortage. These two numbers,
however, serve as a constraint for the efficiency of the energy storage technology,
i.e.

<!--l. 228--><p class="noindent" >Although the previous analysis provides the average storage value, the real
time electricity surplus that needs to be stored varies with time. The same
occurs with the electricity shortage, i.e. the occasional electricity shortage
can be much higher than its long-term average value. Both of these values
are shown in Fig. <a 
href="#x1-2003r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Electricity-surplus-smooth --></a>. Any feasible storage process must be able to store a
maximum power surplus of 5.0 to 10.0 GW (see the peaks of the curves in
Fig. <a 
href="#x1-2003r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Electricity-surplus-smooth --></a>-left) and recuperate the stored power with a maximum rate of 3.0
to 6.0 GW (see the peaks of the curves in Fig. <a 
href="#x1-2003r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Electricity-surplus-smooth --></a>-right). These values are
critical in the design of the storage and recuperation processes. The sizing
of the required equipment and sub-processes will be discussed in the next
sections.
<!--l. 241--><p class="noindent" >We end this section by estimating the subsurface volume that is required to store
enough energy to cover for a eight month energy shortage. Table <a

per unit mole of different energy storage media that are studied in this report.
Exergy, <span

mechanical work, i.e. movement. The maximum efficiency of producing each medium,

thickness of 100 m, the diameter of a chalk reservoir that can store the equivalent of
eight-month electricity shortage in 2050 is visualized in Fig. <a

calculated assuming an efficiency factor of one for all the energy conversions. A 2
to 3 times larger reservoir volume is required if all the efficiency factors
are included in the computations. All in all, the required volume for the
energy storage is only a small fraction of the available reservoir volumes in
the North Sea. Therefore, the reservoir volume is not a bottleneck in the
subsurface energy storage. A reservoir with a thickness of 100 m and a radius
between 100 m to 3000 m (considering the efficiency factors) can hold enough
energy to compensate for 8 months of electricity shortage in Denmark in
2050.

production of the synthetic fuels must come from the dead state, i.e. atmosphere and
sea water. The dead state refers to the average composition of the atmosphere,
Earth&#8217;s crust, and oceans that theoretically does not have any potential to do
work. Here, we consider the production of hydrogen, ammonia, methane,
and methanol. The raw material for the production of these fuels are air
and seawater and the only driving force for the production processes is the
surplus electricity from the windfarms. From the atmosphere, nitrogen and
carbon dioxide need to be separated. From the seawater, hydrogen will be
extracted via an electrolysis process. These processes are discussed in the next
section.

this process, shown in Fig. <a

through a series of heat exchangers. The liquefied air then enters a high
pressure followed by a low pressure distillation column. The separation of
nitrogen from oxygen and other minor constituents of air is done based on
the difference of their boiling points. Nitrogen is separated from the top
side of the low pressure column. To liquefy air, a utility stream of around
-200<sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">o</span></sup>C is required, that is often provided through the sudden expansion of a
compressed refrigerant. Therefore, the entropy generation is high and the process
is exergy intensive. Different values are reported in the literature for the
electricity consumption per unit mole of separated nitrogen. These values depend
on the heat integration of the process. The largest value reported in the
literature is around 15 kJ/mol air distilled. In our simulation, we obtained
a value of 32 kJ/mol, which is perhaps due to the poor heat integration
in the simplified simulations; thus, we used the value of 15 kJ/mol in our
analysis.

For the offshore hydrogen production and storage, the following aspects
need further investigations: fitting the water treatment, electrolysis, and

transport); physico-bio-chemical interactions of hydrogen with the formation fluids
and the chalk reservoir; capacity of reservoirs for storage of hydrogen and
flow of hydrogen in the reservoir; energy efficiency and economic value of

Rosen assumes an exergy efficiency of around 70% for the electrolysis of
water for a mature electrolysis technology in 1995 (not considering other
losses). He does not give more information on other steps of the process, e.g.
water treatment and purification. There are several technologies to produce
hydrogen from water using electricity among which two are more mature
and are available as commercial packages, viz. alkaline electrolysis <span class="cite">[<a

polymer electrolyte membrane cells (PEM) <span class="cite">[<a

renewable resources, the produced hydrogen is called &#8220;green hydrogen&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a

An efficiency of 60% to 70% is expected for these electrolysis processes, in
which most of the energy loss is converted to heat. The energy loss during
the compression of hydrogen will be calculated separately in the following
sections.
<!--l. 470--><p class="noindent" >The storage of hydrogen in the subsurface is a relatively old topic <span class="cite">[<a

subsurface storage of green hydrogen is being studied by several investigators in
different continents.

<!--l. 478--><p class="noindent" >As this report is being written, there are several green hydrogen production projects
being announced. Ørsted has announced that as part of the project H2RES,
supported by The Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Programme
(EUDP) under the Danish Energy Agency, a hydrogen production unit with a 2 MW
capacity will be built by the end of 2021 <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XOrstedTakesFinal">2</a>]</span> that will produce up to 1000
kg/day of green hydrogen. These capacities, although an step forward, will
not address the GW scale energy shortage that will certainly occur due to
the intermittent nature of renewable electricity, as was discussed in section
<a 
href="#x1-10001">1<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:Problem-definition --></a>.
<!--l. 489--><p class="noindent" >The other issue that needs to be addressed here is the footprint of the electrolysis
equipment. We saw in section <a 
href="#x1-10001">1<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:Problem-definition --></a> that the synthetic fuel production units are expected
to consume several GW of surplus electricity. The main problem with these large
amounts of power is that the electrolysis units are currently designed and built in
MW scale. For example, one of the largest commercial PEM electrolysis units offered
by NEL hydrogen has a capacity of 25 MW and requires 3<span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x00D7;</span>12 m<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sup> area for
installation. Therefore, a 500 MW electrolysis plant that is made of 20 PEM
cells is unlikely to to fit on a platform with other equipment although it is
not impossible. A better option for the offshore hydrogen production is the
installation of these electrolysis cells onboard a ship designed for this purpose.
Otherwise, the onshore production of hydrogen seems to be the more realistic
option.
<!--l. 504--><p class="noindent" >Last but not least is the conversion of the stored hydrogen to electricity. Currently,
there is no gas turbine that can work with pure hydrogen as a fuel. Therefore, the
produced hydrogen must be mixed with a hydrocarbon fuel such as methane. This
will cause some carbon dioxide emission unless a carbon capture process is used,
which will in turn reduce the efficiency of the process. Fitting a GW scale
turbine on a platform is possible but similar to electrolysis cells highly unlikely
for GW capacities. As an example, Dan F host 6,800 tonnes of facilities
and provides a power of 55 MW to the facilities. The highest point on the
platform is 132 m above water. A typical 25 MW turbine that is designed for
offshore platforms and consumes a mixture of methane and hydrogen weighs
approximately 250 tonnes. Therefore, up to several hundred MW of gas turbine
capacity can fit on a platform. But reaching to GW capacities can be a
challenge.

hydrogen, can be obtained from the air and seawater by the cryogenic air
separation and electrolysis units, respectively. The nitrogen and hydrogen
feed streams are compressed to 150 to 250 bar and react in a packed bed
reactor at 673 to 773 K. The reaction is exothermic and therefore does not
require external heating; it also produces high temperature heat that can be
used in the process. The process can fit on a platform even for large scale
ammonia production. However, as discussed before, the electrolysis unit for GW
scale production of hydrogen does not fit on the platform. The cryogenic
separation of nitrogen from air can fit on the platform; however, having
long and heavy distillation columns (i.e. 60 theoretical trays) that work at
very low temperatures on a platform can present several challenges for the
stability of the platform and the extra room that is needed for the utilities.
Therefore, we suggest an alternative design that is shown in Fig. <a 
href="#x1-9002r7">7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:ammonia-new-design --></a>. In this
new design, the separation of nitrogen from the atmosphere is done by a
combustion reaction between the green hydrogen (produced in an electrolysis
unit) and air in a gas turbine and later separating the mixture of steam and
nitrogen by condensing the steam in a two phase separator. The separated
nitrogen can either go to another Rankine cycle to produce some extra work or
go to the ammonia reactor via a multistage compressor, where it reacts
with compressed green hydrogen. The efficiency of the process is calculated
by

<!--l. 828--><p class="noindent" >In this section, we discuss the results of the compressed air storage and ammonia
storage in the Harald West field. The permeability field is as shown in Fig. <a 
href="#x1-13004r10">10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Permeability-field --></a>. A
radius of 20 m around the well is stimulated to obtain a permeability 100 times
higher than the average permeability of the reservoir. This stimulation is necessary
for the injection of the large flow rates that are required for the storage of energy in
MW to GW scales. The withdrawal from the reservoir starts on 1st of December 2050
whenever there is an electricity shortage. The production rate is adjusted such that
the bottom hole pressure is high enough, i.e. it can overcome the pressure drop in the
well and also generate electricity in the gas turbine on the platform. The efficiency
of the turbine is similar to the efficiency of the injection compressor and
does not vary with the operating condition. We assume that 20 MW of the
surplus electricity is directed to the compressed air storage unit in Harald
West.
<!--l. 844--><p class="noindent" >In the previous section, we saw that the storage of compressed air which has a
limited exergy value (i.e. potential to do mechanical work) compared to synthetic
fuels requires larger volumes and subsequently very high injection and withdrawal
rates that leads to unrealistically large pressure gradients in the reservoir.
This is a problem that can be addressed by the conversion and storage of
energy in a medium with a higher exergy per unit volume such as ammonia.
Here, we assume that 100 MW of the surplus electricity is provided to the
ammonia production and storage unit in Harald West, which is 5 times higher
than the electricity consumption in the compressed air storage unit. As can
be seen in Fig. <a 
href="#x1-14001r11">11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Bottom-hole-pressure-NH3 --></a>, the injection pressure in the reservoir is only 150 bar
higher than the hydrostatic pressure and thus within a reasonable range. The
pressure fluctuation is between 200 to 350 bar, which can create geomechanical
failure in the reservoir and needs to be further investigated. Once again, the
production rate is controlled by the low permeability of the reservoir as
can be seen in Fig. <a 
href="#x1-14002r12">12<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Pressure-profile-NH3 --></a>. To avoid a negative bottom hole pressure in the
simulations, we imposed a withdrawal rate limit that is 20% of the maximum
injection rate during the storage phase. With this limit, the efficiency of the
electricity production (assuming an efficiency of 60% for the conversion of
ammonia to electricity) from the stored ammonia is only 2.3%. This is higher
than the efficiency of compressed air energy storage but does not provide
the 72% efficiency that is required for a feasible storage solution that can
address the intermittency of renewable electricity production in the North Sea
windfarms.

300 m radius around the well. Considering only the areas with a lower pressure as
non-reproducible zones and by integrating the concentration of ammonia in those
zones, an initial loss of 30% can be expected for the injected ammonia. We expect
that the synthetic fuel loss in the reservoir will not increase significantly and only
occurs at the beginning of the storage process in which the reservoir is pressurized for
the future re-production.

overall energy efficiency remains unchanged. This implies that the subsurface storage
of physical and chemical energy must be performed in a confined zone, e.g. a salt
cavern, instead of a large reservoir in which the fluids can spread due to the diffusive
nature of flow in a porous medium.

physical, i.e. compressed air and chemical, i.e. synthetic fuels to address the
intermittency of the renewable wind power. We showed that
     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-15002x1">Any potential energy storage solution must have an energy loss of less
     than 30%. Currently, only hydropower storage and batteries offer this
     efficiency,  which  are  location  dependent  and  only  available  in  smaller
     scales, respectively. None of the studied synthetic fuels, with the possible
     exception of green hydrogen in certain conditions, can be produced with
     the required efficiency.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-15004x2">For  2050,  a  capacity  of  greater  than  1000  MW  electricity  storage  is
     required. The largest commercial hydrogen electrolysis units are in the
     order of 20 MW and have a relatively large footprint that makes them
     unsuitable for the offshore installations. Moreover, there is currently no
     hydrogen gas turbine in the market and hydrogen can only be utilized in
     hydrocarbon mixtures.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-15006x3">Methanol and methane require a large carbon source, e.g. CO<sub><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sub>. Air capture
     (the direct absorption of CO<sub><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sub>from the atmosphere) is energy intensive
     and reduces the overall production efficiency of the carbon-based liquid
     and gaseous fuels. They also have a large footprint and do not fit on the
     offshore platforms. The only other option is the capture and transportation
     of CO<sub><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sub> from the point sources by pipelines or ships to the platforms for
     the production of methane and methanol. The production processes can
     fit easily on a platform.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-15008x4">Ammonia  is  the  most  promising  fuel  by  a  relatively  high  synthesis
     efficiency and a low footprint (since it does not require a carbon source).
     We introduced a new design that does not need cryogenic air separation
     and is more suitable for the offshore ammonia production.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-15010x5">The near-well and pipeline pressure drops limit the compressed air storage

     capacity to 10-20 MW through a single vertical well in the Harald West
     gas reservoir. Moreover, the storage is limited to high-perm sandstone or
     highly stimulated or fractured chalk reservoirs since very large flow rates
     need to pass through the reservoir that creates large pressure gradients
     and pressure fluctuations that can make the reservoir unstable (from a
     mechanical point of view).
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-15012x6">Recuperation of the stored fuel with the desired flow rate is a limiting
     factor in all the studied cases. It reduces the efficiency of energy storage
     to the unfeasible values of 1-2%.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-15014x7">A  confined  subsurface  space,  e.g.  a  salt  cavern,  is  a  more  realistic
     alternative to the fuel storage in the North sea reservoirs.</li></ol>
<!--l. 959--><p class="noindent" >The simulation files offer the possibility of linking the Aspen Plus process simulation
flowsheets to the subsurface storage models through a Matlab script, which can
provide an automated solution for investigating more subsurface energy storage
scenarios and the possible optimization of processes.
