\begin_layout Title
Physical and chemical energy storage in the abandoned offshore reservoirs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

\begin_layout Abstract
The existing and in development offshore windmills in the North Sea will
 ensure the availability of abundant and cheap electricity in the region,
 yet fail to address the intermittent nature of the wind resources.
 The surplus electricity in the windy days and off peak time can be converted
 to physical (compressed and hot fluids) or chemical (synthetic fuels such
 as ammonia, methanol, or methane) forms and stored in the reservoirs.
 The stored energy is extracted and converted to electricity when there
 is a shortage of wind, or consumed as clean fuels for transportation.
 This project aims to study the feasibility of subsurface physical and chemical
 energy storage and extraction as an alternative for the abandonment of
 the North Sea oil and gas reservoirs.
 The feasibility and environmental impacts/benefits of the following energy
 storage processes will be investigated:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Hydrogen: recent developments in the electrolysis technology has considerably
 increased the efficiency of hydrogen production from water.
 If the process is driven by the clean wind electricity, the produced hydrogen
 is a zero-emission fuel.
 Currently, hydrogen is included in all the energy scenarios in the North
 Sea region countries.
 For the offshore hydrogen production and storage, the following aspects
 need further investigations:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In this research, the energy requirement of the process, the size of the
 process equipment, and the reactive flow of hydrogen in the chalk reservoirs
 will be addressed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Methane: methane has the lowest carbon dioxide (CO2) emission among the
 fossil fuels, and therefore is considered as one of the fuels in the low-CO2-em
ission 2050 energy scenarios for Europe.
 There are two possibilities for the storage and production of methane:
 synthetic production of methane from electricity, and the bio-catalytic
 conversion of the remaining oil to methane in the abandoned reservoirs.
 The synthetic production of methane requires a carbon source such as CO2,
 which is unlikely to be provided from a point source or captured from the
 atmospheric CO2.
 Therefore, here the focus is on the upgrading of the remaining oil in the
 reservoir to methane.
 Hydrogen from electrolysis can also be included in the process to increase
 the share of the stored clean energy.
 The focus will be on the insitu upgrading of the crude oil, energy efficiency
 of the process, and the economic value and CO2 emission of the process
 and its final product.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Methanol: catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (or other carbon-containing
 molecules) and hydrogen to methanol is successfully demonstrated in many
 academic and industrial projects and is a proven technology.
 Since methanol is in liquid phase at standard conditions, it is easier
 to handle and store it and there is a smaller risk of leakage.
 However, its production requires a carbon source that can be provided,
 e.g., from the atmospheric CO2 or methane (see the previous bullet point).
 Here, the focus will be on the process equipment that fit on a platform
 and the energy efficiency of the overall production and storage process
 (including the flow of methanol in the reservoir and its loss due to mixing)
 and its economic value and environmental impact.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Ammonia: since the ingredients for the production of ammonia, i.e., nitrogen
 from the air and hydrogen from the seawater, are available in abundance,
 it is one of the fuels that can be both synthesized and stored offshore
 provided that the process equipment for the separation of nitrogen from
 air and treatment and electrolysis of seawater can be installed on a platform.
 This research will study the topside equipment design specifications for
 the production of ammonia and its storage in the reservoir.
 The flow of ammonia in the reservoir and its interaction with the reservoir
 fluids, the energy efficiency and power requirement of the process, and
 the environmental impacts are the main topics of investigation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Compressed air: subsurface storage of compressed air is one of the energy
 storage methods that is widely investigated to address the intermittent
 nature of wind and solar electricity and to store the electricity produced
 during the off-peak time in the fossil-fuel power plants.
 There are two major issues that needs to be addressed here: the mechanical
 properties of the reservoir and whether it can handle this cyclic compression/d
ecompression process, and the total energy loss during the compression of
 the gas, the pressure drop close to the injectors and producers, and the
 expansion of the compressed gas in turbines.
 Here, by developing a model for the process including the flow of air in
 the porous media, all the energy losses of the process will be quantified
 in order to calculate the net percentage of the electricity that can be
 stored in a North Sea chalk reservoir or deeper in a salt cavern.

\begin_layout Abstract
Since a large volume of work needs to be done in a four-month time frame,
 utmost care will be taken not to repeat the already existing research.
 Moreover, the feasibility study will be carried out based on the existing
 fundamental and universally accepted measures such as Energy Return on
 Energy Investment (EROEI) or exergy analysis.
 The economic analysis will be built on top of the fundamental physical
 measures.

 shows a gas reservoir represented as a cylindrical domain.
 The top and bottom of the reservoir are closed, i.e.
 no flow, and the outskirt of the domain can either be closed or at hydrostatic
 pressure.
 The top side of the reservoir is located at depth 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 [m], the thickness of the reservoir is 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{res}$
\end_inset

 [m] and the radius of the well and the reservoir are 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5D_{well}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{res}$

] and the porosity is 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

=0.37.
 The reservoir is located close to an offshore windfarm and a surplus electricit
y of negligible price is provided to the operator to produce ammonia and
 store it in the subsurface.
 Ammonia is produced by a catalytic reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N_{2}+3H_{2}\rightarrow2NH_{3}.
\]

\end_inset

Nitrogen is separated from the atmosphere in a cryogenic air separation
 process and hydrogen is produced from the seawater in an electrolysis unit.
 All the separation and conversion is done offshore on the platform.
 There is no constant supply of electricity as the weather forecast gives
 the wind speed only a day in advance and the windfarm needs to provide
 electricity to the grid.
 The surplus electricity that is given to the ammonia production and storage
 fluctuates between 10 to 1000 MW.

The objective of this work is to calculate the energy loss in the process
 of producing, storing, and extracting ammonia as a synthetic fuel.

This problem will be addressed in two steps.
 First, the air separation, electrolysis, and ammonia synthesis processes
 will be simulated in Aspen Plus commercial process simulators.
 Depending on the limitations in the software and time restrictions, different
 levels of details will be included in the process models.
 These models are utilized to estimate the energy efficiency of the ammonia
 synthetic, i.e.
 the amount of electricity required to synthesize one unit mass of ammonia.
 The next step is the simulation of the subsurface storage and production.
 A simplified cylindrical reservoir model with a single well for the injection
 and production of ammonia will be created in COMSOL Multiphysics software
 with the boundary conditions described in Fig.

 The reservoir is initially at hydrostatic pressure at a constant temperature
 of 70
\begin_inset Formula $^{o}$
\end_inset

C and the concentration of ammonia in the reservoir is zero.
 The reservoir will be described by the single phase single component flow
 of an slightly compressible miscible fluid (ammonia) in the reservoir.
 The partial differential equations that describe the system are formulated
 in the next section.

\begin_layout Section
Single phase flow formulation

The single phase compressible flow in porous media reads
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\varphi\rho\right)+\nabla.\left(\rho\mathbf{u}\right)=0,

where the Darcy velocity (assuming single phase flow and negligible gravity
 effect) and the fluid density are described as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{u}=-\frac{k}{\mu}\nabla p,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho=\rho_{0}+\left(\frac{d\rho}{dp}\right)_{p_{0}}\left(p-p_{0}\right).
\]

\end_inset

The flow of ammonia in the subsurface is described by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\varphi c\right)+\nabla\left(\mathbf{u}c-\varphi\mathcal{D}\nabla c\right)=0.
\]

 In the above equations,

\begin_inset Formula $c$

 [mol/m
\begin_inset Formula $^{3}$
\end_inset

] is the concentration of ammonia.
 Both viscosity and density are a function of ammonia concentration; however,
 we ignore this functionality in the preliminary model.
 The injection rate in the well is a function of the supplied electricity.
 We assume that for a week a constant power of 1 MW is provided for the
 synthesis of ammonia and in the following week, there is no supply of electrici
ty (i.e.
 ammonia needs to be extracted from the reservoir).
 The pumping energy is calculated based on the calculated injection pressure
 in the well.
 Assume that the reservoir is initially filled with water and the ammonia
 and water are miscible.

Synthetic fuel
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The production of synthetic fuels can be sustainable and carbon-neutral
 if the raw material for the synthesis process is obtained from renewable
 sources and the process is driven by renewable energy, e.g.
 wind energy.
 In this work, we look into the synthesis of methane, methanol, and ammonia.
 We assume that the raw material is carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the
 atmosphere and hydrogen from the seawater.

Methanation reactor

Carbon dioxide can be reduced to methane via Sabatier reaction, that reads
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
CO2+4H2\rightleftarrows CH_{4}+2H_{2}O\qquad\Delta H_{0}=-165\,\textrm{kJ/mol}.
\]

\end_inset

This reaction can be a pathway to sustainable fuel if the carbon dioxide
 can be extracted from the atmosphere and hydrogen can be provided from
 the electrolysis of water driven by renewable electricity.
 The reaction can be catalyzed by nickel or ruthenium and can be conducted
 in a packed bed reactor.
 The reaction rate in different ranges of pressure and temperature are reported
 in the literature.
 Although other reactions can occur at the high temperature and pressure
 of the methanations reactors, it is observed that the selectivity of the
 reaction towards methane is high
